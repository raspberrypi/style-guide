# Raspberry Pi style guide

This document is being updated constantly; please ensure you have the most recent version.
 
When preparing copy for UK or international audiences (that is, the vast majority of our content), unless the matter is mentioned below, please consult *New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Guide to Style*. If a particular spelling or hyphenation choice is not specified here, the version in the *Oxford English Dictionary* is to be preferred.

When editing copy that is intended specifically for a US audience, refer to *the Associated Press Stylebook*.

Raspberry Pi strives for an approachable, conversational tone in its materials. See www.raspberrypi.com for examples.

## Lists  

Use semicolons for lists with internal commas. *We received bouquets from Chris, in California; Jim, in Belgium; and Bob, in Liverpool.*

Complicated lists are usually better presented typographically with bullets or numerals, but don't resort to bulleted lists just because it's the easiest option: consider narrative flow and page layout. Bullets should be used for lists of items with no hierarchy, numerals for lists of items with hierarchy, and for steps in a process (for example tutorials). Letters should never be used for list points. Bullet points take a capital letter but do not take a full stop (this includes the final list item) unless one or more of the bulleted list items is made up of more than one sentence, in which case all points on the list should have a full stop, even if they are fragments. 

A bulleted list should be introduced with a colon: 

*   First list item 
*   Second list item 
*   Third list item 
 
See **Titles of other works** below for more examples of bulleted lists. 

## Emphasis 

Use *italic* type for emphasis. Note: this is a change to reflect our normal usage. We used to prefer **bold** type for emphasis, but it's clear that it's not what writers and editors here default to, so *italics* win (and we've used bold so little for emphasis that there's little point in going back through and retroactively mopping up). 

## Punctuation 

Oxford commas should be used throughout; they resolve ambiguity and should be used elsewhere for consistency. *We photographed the components, a sandwich, and a magnet.*  

Do you find yourself adding more and more commas to make your sentence readable? Perhaps it would be better if you split it into two sentences instead. That said, at Raspberry Pi we're committed to railing against the death of the semicolon; it's a very useful piece of punctuation.

Hyphen (-):

In general,
*   Hyphenate two or more modifiers before a noun unless the first modifier is an adjective that modifies the complete noun phrase. *The moderators are fascist-robot enthusiasts. The moderators are fascist robot enthusiasts.*
*   Compound nouns that are used as a modifier before a noun need not always be hyphenated; if a hyphen makes them look stuffy and old-fashioned, leave it out. *Machine vision applications, science fiction titles, labour market liberalisation*.
*   Do not hyphenate compound modifiers that follow a noun. *We try to make sure our advice on hyphenation remains up to date* (but *What's a good channel for up-to-date advice on home fungiculture?*)
*   Do not hyphenate adjectival compounds which begin with adverbs ending -ly. *A gorgeously constructed computer*.
*   Add a hyphen on the end of multiple items that are joined to another word in this way. _A 12- and 15-month subscription, full- and part-time jobs_.
*   Consult en dash rules for more complex hyphenation cases.
*   Consult *Hart's Rules* for more complex hyphenation cases where the en dash rules aren't helping you out.

En dash (–):
*   Use a closed-up en dash when writing ranges. _7–17, Monday–Friday_.
*   Use a closed-up en dash when expressing a connection, relation, or alternative. _Dover–Calais crossing, Williams–Navratilova match_.
*   Use a closed-up en dash to form compound words either when one of the components is itself a hyphenated word, or when one of the components is formed of two words. _Raspberry Pi–powered, e-book–only publisher, public school–educated student, liberal–conservative debate_.

Em dash (—):
*   Use an em dash with space either side for parenthetical statements. Em dashes express a more pronounced break in the sentence than commas, and also draw more attention to the parenthetical. They express less of a break than parentheses, and are more informal. Do *not* overuse em dashes. _I didn't have an educated background — Dad was a farm labourer._
*   Use a pair of em dashes with space either side for making a parenthetical statement in the middle of a sentence. If using punctuation in the parenthetical, the closing dash may only be preceded by an exclamation or question mark and the following word may not be capitalised, even if it begins a sentence (unless it is a proper noun). E.g. _The party lasted — we knew it would! — far longer than planned._

Colon:
*   When a colon is used in free text, the letter following the colon should be lower-case. E.g. _I have three dogs: a small one, a medium one, and a big one._
*   When a colon is preceded by a header-style construction, the letter following the colon should be upper-case. E.g. _Note: This wouldn’t look so great with a lower-case t._

Quotation marks (' and "):
*   Do *not* use scare quotes (quotation marks put around a word or phrase in a written sentence in order to show that the word is being used in a special way, or in a way that may not be correct or true). Scare quotes make for vague, sensationalist writing. You can write better than that.
*   Use single quotes to highlight a word/phrase when needed, such as when you introduce a new term, need to offset a title. E.g. _Ask what the word 'system' means._ or _Hand out the ‘Bicycle system’ activity sheet._
   *   Be judicious in your use of quotation marks in this way: if the word/phrase stands out to the reader without them, leave them out; if the reader might stumble over the word/phrase without them, put them in.
*   Use double quotation marks **only** to indicate actual quoted speech.
   *   In large sections of quoted speech, put double quotation marks at the end of each paragraph rather than omitting them, as per the Oxford Guide to Style.

Fragments (e.g. for definitions) do not take a full stop at the end. _An isolated or incomplete part of something_

Do not use apostrophes in abbreviated plurals: *PCs, BGAs*. Apostrophes may be used when an abbreviation is turned into a verb, although it is best practice to avoid doing this altogether: *My mother won't stop IM'ing me.* (This example is from the deep past, when mothers IM'd. Now they WhatsApp us.)

Do *not* use ampersands (&); always use 'and'. The exception might be in a print article for one of our magazines, where space is at a premium.

## Titles of other works 

Titles of other works should be set in title case (first and last words take an initial capital, regardless of length of word or part of speech; all other words in the title *except* articles, prepositions of three or fewer letters and conjunctions of three or fewer letters, and the words *if, how* and *why* should also take an initial capital.)  

As a general rule with *software in particular*, check the manufacturer's capitalisation style. Many examples of software title capitalisation are in the word list below; if you encounter more that you think we add, please start a pull request. 

Treatment of the titles depends on the type of work. In general, titles should be set in *italics*.

Italicise the titles of the following types of works: artworks; books, book chapters and other parts of books; CDs; albums; DVDs; songs; lectures; magazine and newspaper articles; films; operas; plays; podcasts and episodes of podcasts; poems; speeches with titles; television and radio programmes and episodes; web shows; webinars; and online videos. 

Do **not** italicise titles if they fall under one of the following categories: 

*   Blogs. The titles of individual blog posts should be set in italics (unless the blog publishes posts under a date only).
*   Games. Computer games, board games, card games, arcade games. 
*   Magazines and newspapers. The titles of specific articles from magazines and newspapers *should*, however, be set in italics. 
*   Websites.
*   Software.

But wait! There's more! 

If compiling a numbered or bulleted list of titles *which are like items*, the titles do not need to be set in italics because they do not need to stand out from surrounding text. A similar list of titles which are not like items should be set in italics where they are required. 

Jemima's favourite old movies are: 

*   Gone With the Wind 
*   Singin' in the Rain 
*   The Third Man 
 
These are a few of my favourite things: 

*   Sausages 
*   Banditry 
*   *Anne of Green Gables* 

## Raspberry Pi computers, microcontroller devices, microcontroller boards, and camera modules

Are you talking about Raspberry Pi the concept, or about a specific Raspberry Pi?  If you're writing about the product line, then "Raspberry Pi 4", "Raspberry Pi Zero", "Raspberry Pi Pico", "Raspberry Pi RP2040", "Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2", and so on; not "_the_ Raspberry Pi 4" or "_the_ Raspberry Pi Zero", and not just "Pi 4" or "Pi Zero". 

If you're writing about a specific Raspberry Pi: one your reader is using in a project, or the one you're holding in your hand, use the appropriate article. "Pick up a Raspberry Pi." "Insert a microSD card into your Raspberry Pi." "Mount the HAT on the Raspberry Pi."

The plural of "Raspberry Pi" is "Raspberry Pis" (no apostrophe); but use "Raspberry Pi computers", "Raspberry Pi devices", etc. where possible.

To check official nomenclature, refer to the Product Names Register on Cognidox internally, or the [products page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/).

Be careful with using _Raspberry Pi 1_ — the _1_ is only necessary when you need to clearly distinguish it from other models.
If you want to shorten the name of a model, do it like this: _Raspberry Pi 2 Model B_ > _Raspberry Pi 2B_

When listing several products and/or models, it's usually possible, and more elegant, to do so without writing out the name of each product or model in full. For example:

Not

_Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Raspberry Pi 2, Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi 3+, and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3_

but

_Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Raspberry Pi 2, 3 and 3+, and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3_

or even, daringly,

_Raspberry Pi 2, 3, 3+ and Zero 2 W, and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3_

(note that both examples above omit an Oxford comma where we would usually include one, in the cause of helping the reader to parse the lists correctly).

## Other Raspberry Pi products

Almost all accessories, PSUs, and add-on boards take a definite article ("the") before their product name: "the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT", "the Raspberry Pi Mouse", "the Raspberry Pi Touch Display", "the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera" (note that camera modules do not take a definite article, but the High Quality Camera does; that's to do with how horribly clunky "the Raspberry Pi Camera Module _n_" sounds). It is usually desirable to omit "Raspberry Pi" from the name in most instances following the first mention. "You can do all kind of experiments with the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT, which is why there are two of them on the International Space Station. The Sense HAT has an array of sensors, a five-button joystick, and an 8x8 RGB LED matrix." "We recommend using the Raspberry Pi USB-C Power Supply, which represents excellent value."

## Capitalisation 

First word in chapter headings and titles take an initial capital, others lower case. (Sentence case.) 

In all text, try to avoid the use of a trademark whose initial letter is in lower case (iPad, element14) at the start of a sentence or title. *iPad sales soar* is only ever acceptable if typography means that there is insufficient space for *Sales of iPad soar*. 

## Abbreviations and acronyms 

Spell out abbreviations in the first instance in a chapter section, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. Thereafter use the abbreviation. *Raspberry Pi's brain is a system on a chip (SoC), made by stacking a memory chip on top of a processor chip. Using an SoC keeps the area of the Raspberry Pi board low.*

Abbreviations should not be marked in this format: ***S**ystem **o**n a **C**hip*.

See the word list below for correct abbreviations and their capitalisations when spelt out. Be aware that the fact that something is often acronymised does not imply that the thing itself takes capitals. So ASAP does not imply that As Soon As Possible is the correct capitalisation. (Although some acronyms when expanded do require capitalisation: NASA, ASCII etc. Check the word list or Google the organisation if you're not sure.)

## Numerals and numbers

Unless you are dealing with code, units of computer storage, or maths materials/equations, spell out numbers one to twelve; express 13 and higher numbers as a numeral *unless* at the start of a sentence. *Eighteen bagpipers were shown to the door.* 

For a range of numbers, try to keep a consistent format: *coding clubs for children aged 9-13*, *Pioneers are aged 11-16*, *one to twenty*. Use common sense: if following the style guide looks awful, (*coding clubs for children aged nine to 13*, *one to 20*), use a consistent format instead.

For numbers of more than four digits, use commas: *10,000*, *100,000*.

There should be no space between a value and its SI unit: *2m*, *2kg*, *2ohm*. There should also be no space between a value and a unit of storage: *8MB*, *8GB*, *8TB*. 

Subscript numerals (e.g. in chemical formulae) are fine in print, but not for online content. So *CO2* online, *CO<sub>2</sub>*  in print. 

Use the multiplication symbol × when required, not the letter x. 

School grades (USA): Spell out first through ninth grade and use figures for 10th grade or higher. Try to keep a consistent format for ranges, as above.

## URLs 

Omit http://www from URLs in print. Use hyperlinks in online content. 

## Time and date 

Use the 12-hour clock. Include the appropriate time zone abbreviation for North American events. Use a full stop to separate hours and minutes. Separate the time and 'am/pm' with a thin space in print. *5am PDT, 8.20pm, 12 noon EST, 12 midnight*, etc.

Dates should be expressed *21 Jan 2006* etc. to avoid confusion with month/day ordering for readers outside the UK. Abbreviate months thus: *Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.* If it's necessary to include the day of the week as well, *Thursday 14 April* is acceptable.

Season names should not be capitalised. 

An x-week period: hyphen between number and 'week'. *A six-week period*.

When referring to decades, use *the eighties* or *the 1980s*, but never *the '80s*. When referring to two decades use *the 1970s and 1980s*, even though *the 1970s and '80s* more accurately shows how such dates may be read out loud. When the name of a decade is used to define a social or cultural period it should be written as a word.

## Race, disability, gender 

*Indian people* (or *Egyptian people, black people, Jewish people*, etc.) never *Indians, Egyptians, blacks* or *Jews*. Similarly, use *disabled* as an adjective, never a noun. *Disabled people*, not *the disabled*. 

Example access statement for Picademy: *The venue is described as being accessible for people with limited mobility. If you will need to use a car to access the venue, or if you have other access requirements or would like further information, please get in touch via email and let us know how we can help.*; further examples: www.accessibilityguides.org/prepare

Copy should be gender neutral as far as possible. Using *they* as a singular pronoun is acceptable, and is preferable to alternating *he* and *she*, which can be clumsy and immersion breaking for the reader. Where possible, make nouns and pronouns plural: *Students should enter their passwords* is preferable to *Each student should enter his or her password.* 

Avoid gendered job titles; there is usually an alternative. So *firefighter* instead of *fireman*; *flight attendant* instead of *stewardess.*  

Avoid *man, mankind, manmade, manpower* etc. There are plenty of alternatives. 
 
## Spelling 
 
In copy written primarily for a UK or an international audience, UK English should be used, with the exception of international organisations- for example, The John F Kennedy Space *Center*.

In copy intended specifically for a US audience, US English should be used.
