# Raspberry Pi Style Guide 2.0

This document is based on the original Style Guide from days of yore. It is a work in progress; the word list is still being updated to remove obsolete and duplicate entries, and there will also be specific sections on website guidelines in future.
 
When preparing copy for UK or international audiences (that is, the vast majority of our content), unless the matter is mentioned below, please consult *New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Guide to Style*. If a particular spelling or hyphenation choice is not specified here, the version in the *Oxford English Dictionary* is to be preferred.

When editing copy that is intended specifically for a US audience, refer to *the Associated Press Stylebook*.

Raspberry Pi strives for an approachable, conversational tone in its materials. See www.raspberrypi.org for examples.

## Lists  

Use semicolons for lists with internal commas. *We received bouquets from Chris, in California; Jim, in Belgium; and Bob, in Liverpool.*

Complicated lists are usually better presented typographically with bullets or numerals. Bullets should be used for lists of items with no hierarchy, numerals for lists of items with hierarchy, and for steps in a process (for example tutorials). Letters should never be used for list points. Bullet points take a capital letter but do not take a full stop (this includes the final list item) unless one or more of the bulleted list items is made up of more than one sentence, in which case all points on the list should have a full stop, even if they are fragments. 

A bulleted list should be introduced with a colon: 

*   First list item 
*   Second list item 
*   Third list item 
 
See **Titles of other works** below for more examples of bulleted lists. 

## Emphasis 

Use **bold** type for emphasis. 

## Punctuation 

Oxford commas should be used throughout; they resolve ambiguity and should be used elsewhere for consistency. *We photographed the components, a sandwich, and a magnet.*  

Hyphen (-):

*   Hyphenate two or more modifiers before a noun unless the first adjective modifies the complete noun phrase. *The moderators are fascist-robot enthusiasts. The moderators are fascist robot enthusiasts.*
*   Do not hyphenate adjectival compounds which begin with adverbs ending -ly. *A gorgeously constructed computer*.
*   Add a hyphen on the end of multiple items that are joined to another word in this way. _A 12- and 15-month subscription, full- and part-time jobs_.
*   Consult en dash rules for more complex hyphenation cases.

En dash (–):
*   Use a closed-up en dash when writing ranges. _7–17, Monday–Friday_.
*   Use a closed-up en dash when expressing a connection, relation, or alternative. _Dover–Calais crossing, Williams–Navratilova match_.
*   Use a closed-up en dash to form compound words either when one of the components is itself a hyphenated word, or when one of the components is formed of two words. _Raspberry Pi–powered, e-book–only publisher, public school–educated student, liberal–conservative debate_.

Em dash (—):
*   Use an em dash with space either side for parenthetical statements. Em dashes express a more pronounced break in the sentence than commas, and also draw more attention to the parenthetical. They express less of a break than parentheses, and are more informal. Do **not** overuse em dashes. _I didn't have an educated background — dad was a farm labourer._
*   Use a pair of em dashes with space either side for making a parenthetical statement in the middle of a sentence. If using punctiation in the parenthetical, the closing dash may only be preceded by an exclamation or question mark and the following word may not be capitalised, even if it begins a sentence (unless it is a proper noun). E.g. _The party lasted — we knew it would! — far longer than planned._

Colon:
*   When a colon is used in free text, the letter following the colon should be lower-case. E.g. _I have three dogs: a small one, a medium one, and a big one._
*   When a colon is preceded by a header-style construction, the letter following the colon should be upper-case. E.g. _Note: This wouldn’t look so great with a lower-case t._

Quotation marks (' and "):
*   Do **not** use scare quotes (quotation marks put around a word or phrase in a written sentence in order to show that the word is being used in a special way, or in a way that may not be correct or true). Scare quotes make for vague, sensationalist writing. You can write better than that.
*   Use single quotes to highlight a word/phrase when needed, such as when you introduce a new term, need to offset a title. E.g. _Ask what the word 'system' means._ or _Hand out the ‘Bicycle system’ activity sheet._
   *   Be judicious in your use of quotation marks in this way: if the word/phrase stands out to the reader without them, leave them out; if the reader might stumble over the word/phrase without them, put them in.
*   Use double quotation marks **only** to indicate actual quoted speech.
   *   In large sections of quoted speech, put double quotation marks at the end of each paragraph rather than omitting them, as per the Oxford Guide to Style.

Fragments (e.g. for definitions) do not take a full stop at the end. _An isolated or incomplete part of something_

Do not use apostrophes in abbreviated plurals: *PCs, BGAs*. Apostrophes may be used when an abbreviation is turned into a verb, although it is best practice to avoid doing this altogether: *My mother won't stop IM'ing me.* 

Do **not** use ampersands (&); always use 'and'. The exception might be in a print article for one of our magazines, where space is at a premium.

## Titles of other works 

Titles of other works should be set in title case (first and last words take an initial capital, regardless of length of word or part of speech; all other words in the title **except** articles, prepositions of three or fewer letters and conjunctions of three or fewer letters, and the words *if, how* and *why* should also take an initial capital.)  

As a general rule with **software in particular**, check the manufacturer's capitalisation style. Many examples of software title capitalisation are in the word list below; if you encounter more, please email liz@raspberrypi.com to have them added to the list. 

Treatment of the titles depends on the type of work. In general, titles should be set in *italics*.

Italicise the titles of the following types of works: artworks; books, book chapters and other parts of books; CDs; albums; DVDs; songs; lectures; magazine and newspaper articles; films; operas; plays; podcasts and episodes of podcasts; poems; speeches with titles; television and radio programmes and episodes; web shows; webinars; and online videos. 

Do **not** italicise titles if they fall under one of the following categories: 

*   Blogs. The titles of **individual blog posts should** be set in italics (unless the blog publishes posts under a date only).
*   Games. Computer games, board games, card games, arcade games. 
*   Magazines and newspapers. The titles of **specific articles** from magazines and newspapers **should**, however, be set in italics. 
*   Websites.
*   Software.

But wait! There's more! 

If compiling a numbered or bulleted list of titles **which are like items**, the titles do not need to be set in italics because they do not need to stand out from surrounding text. A similar list of titles which are not ress or clicklike items should be set in italics where they are required. 

Jemima's favourite old movies are: 

*   Gone With the Wind 
*   Singin' in the Rain 
*   The Third Man 
 
These are a few of my favourite things: 

*   Sausages 
*   Banditry 
*   *Anne of Green Gables* 

## *The* Raspberry Pi Foundation

When referring to the Foundation, use "the Raspberry Pi Foundation" with the definite article, never "Raspberry Pi Foundation" on its own without the article. "The Raspberry Pi Foundation" should always be used as the first instance in an article; "the Foundation" is fine subsequently. It's acceptable to omit the "the" on covers and in titles.

For the Raspberry Pi Foundation team: Trustee, Member, founder, co-founder, Board of Trustees, group of Members. Other job titles as here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/team/

## The Raspberry Pi Foundation's charitable status

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales. We can say that the Foundation is "a registered charity" or "UK registered charity 1129409".

The Raspberry Pi Foundation North America is an official charity in the USA. According to the AP Stylebook, the only acceptable style is "501(c)(3)", and it can only be used as an adjective (501(c)(3) is the section of the US tax code that defines what a charity is). The consensus from a discussion with several US-based 501(c)(3) leaders was that it's best to refer to RPFNA as a nonprofit, rather than a charity. Therefore, at the bottom of flyers and similar assets used by RPFNA, we should include the line "The Raspberry Pi Foundation North America is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit”.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is referred to as a "non-profit" rather than a "charity" in copy which specifically addresses an Indian audience, as "charity" can have negative connotations in India.

## Raspberry Pi computers

"Raspberry Pi 4", "Raspberry Pi Zero", and so on; not "_the_ Raspberry Pi 4" or "_the_ Raspberry Pi Zero", and not just "Pi 4" or "Pi Zero". The plural of "Raspberry Pi" is "Raspberry Pis" (no apostrophe); but use "Raspberry Pi computers", "Raspberry Pi devices", etc where possible.

To check official nomenclature, refer to the [products page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/).

Be careful with using _Raspberry Pi 1_ — the _1_ is only necessary when you need to clearly distinguish it from other models.
If you want to shorten the name of a model, do it like this: _Raspberry Pi 2 Model B_ > _Raspberry Pi 2B_

## Capitalisation 

First word in chapter headings and titles take an initial capital, others lower case. (Sentence case.) 
In all text, try to avoid the use of a trademark whose initial letter is in lower case (iPad, element14) at the start of a sentence or title. *iPad sales soar* is only ever acceptable if typography means that there is insufficient space for *Sales of iPad soar*. 

## Abbreviations 

Spell out abbreviations in the first instance in a chapter section, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. Thereafter use the abbreviation. *Raspberry Pi's brain is a system on a chip (SoC), made by stacking a memory chip on top of a processor chip. Using an SoC keeps the area of the Raspberry Pi board low.*

Abbreviations should not be marked in this format: ***S**ystem **o**n a **C**hip*.

See the word list below for correct abbreviations and their capitalisations when spelt out. 

## Numerals and numbers

Unless you are dealing with code, units of computer storage, or maths materials/equations, spell out numbers one to twelve; express 13 and higher numbers as a numeral *unless* at the start of a sentence. *Eighteen bagpipers were shown to the door.* 

For a range of numbers, try to keep a consistent format: *coding clubs for children aged 9-13*, *Pioneers are aged 11-16*, *one to twenty*. Use common sense: if following the style guide looks awful, (*coding clubs for children aged nine to 13*, *one to 20*), use a consistent format instead.

For numbers of more than four digits, use commas: *10,000*, *100,000*.

There should be no space between a value and its SI unit: *2m*, *2kg*, *2ohm*. There should also be no space between a value and a unit of storage: *8MB*, *8GB*, *8TB*. 

Subscript numerals (e.g. in chemical formulae) are fine in print, but not for online content. So *CO2* online, *CO<sub>2</sub>*  in print. 

Use the multiplication symbol × when required, not the letter x. 

School grades (USA): Spell out first through ninth grade and use figures for 10th grade or higher. Try to keep a consistent format for ranges, as above.

## URLs 

Omit http://www from URLs in print. Use hyperlinks in online content. 

## Time and date 

Use the 24-hour clock. Separate hours and minutes with a **colon**. Include the appropriate time zone abbreviation. *8:00 BST, 16:15 GMT, 12:00 (noon), 24:00 (midnight)*, etc.

Use the 12-hour clock in copy that **specifically** targets British or North American audiences (for example, a blog post about an event in New York, or a schedule for a Picademy in Cardiff). Include the appropriate time zone abbreviation for North American events. Use a full stop to separate hours and minutes. Separate the time and 'am/pm' with a thin space in print. *5am PDT, 8.20pm, 12 noon EST, 12 midnight*, etc.

Dates should be expressed *21 Jan 2006* etc. to avoid confusion with month/day ordering for readers outside the UK. Abbreviate months thus: *Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.* 

Season names should not be capitalised. 

An x-week period: hyphen between number and 'week'. *A six-week period*.

When referring to decades, use *the eighties* or *the 1980s*, but never *the '80s*. When referring to two decades use *the 1970s and 1980s*, even though *the 1970s and '80s* more accurately shows how such dates may be read out loud. When the name of a decade is used to define a social or cultural period it should be written as a word.

## Race, disability, gender 

*Indian people* (or *Egyptian people, black people, Jewish people*, etc.) never *Indians, Egyptians, blacks* or *Jews*. Similarly, use *disabled* as an adjective, never a noun. *Disabled people*, not *the disabled*. 

Example access statement for Picademy: *The venue is described as being accessible for people with limited mobility. If you will need to use a car to access the venue, or if you have other access requirements or would like further information, please get in touch via email and let us know how we can help.*; further examples: www.accessibilityguides.org/prepare

Copy should be gender neutral as far as possible. Using *they* as a singular pronoun is acceptable, and is preferable to alternating *he* and *she*, which can be clumsy and immersion breaking for the reader. Where possible, make nouns and pronouns plural: *Students should enter their passwords* is preferable to *Each student should enter his or her password.* 

Avoid gendered job titles; there is usually an alternative. So *firefighter* instead of *fireman*; *flight attendant* instead of *stewardess.*  

Avoid *man, mankind, manmade, manpower* etc. There are plenty of alternatives. 
 
## Markdown-specific guidelines 
 
The main header should be formatted as **h1**, sub-headers as **h2**. Any further sub-headers in the hierarchy should be **h3**, **h4** and so on. Never use bold formatting instead; likewise, never use headers to make text bold. Leave one line break between headers and the main text.

No double spaces after punctuation, please!

Code and code-related words should be formatted with backticks, for example `mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()`. In large code examples, the name of the programming language should be entered after the first set of three backticks (for example, *```python```*). Code must always be indented within lists to prevent the numbering formatting being broken. 

Code blocks and images should have a new line before and after them to improve readability.

Images should not have text in the preceding square brackets []; it should be placed within the regular brackets. For example: 

<pre>![](components.png "Components you will need"). </pre>

'Smart' quotes should be avoided. 

Lists should only be used for step-by-step instructions, not for ordinary paragraphs that don't contain specific instructions. When creating numbered lists, start each item with '1.', rather than ascending numbers. This makes it easier to add steps later without having to change all the others.

Please note that the final section in a resource should be titled **What next?**, not **What's next?**.
 
## Spelling 
 
In copy written primarily for a UK or an international audience, UK English should be used, with the exception of international organisations- for example, The John F Kennedy Space *Center*.

In copy intended specifically for a US audience, US English should be used.
